# Payment Gateway Integration
The PTYou application will handle financial transactions between patients and therapists. We need to integrate a secure and reliable payment gateway to process these transactions.  Key considerations include security, compliance, ease of integration, transaction fees, and support for various payment methods.

## Decision 
We will integrate the Stripe payment gateway into the PTYou application.

## Rationale 
* Security and Compliance: Stripe is a PCI DSS Level 1 certified payment processor, ensuring the highest level of security for handling sensitive financial data.
* Ease of Integration: Stripe provides well-documented APIs and SDKs that simplify the integration process.
* Wide Range of Payment Methods: Stripe supports a variety of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and other popular options, providing flexibility for users.
* Reliability and Uptime: Stripe has a strong track record of reliability and high uptime, ensuring that transactions can be processed smoothly.
* Scalability: Stripe can handle a large volume of transactions, allowing PTYou to scale its payment processing as the user base grows.
* Competitive Pricing: Stripe offers competitive transaction fees.
Rejected Alternatives:
* PayPal: While widely used, PayPal's integration can sometimes be more complex, and its fee structure can be less transparent.
* Braintree: Braintree is a good option, but Stripe is generally considered to have a more developer-friendly API and broader feature set.

## Status
[Proposed | __Accepted__ | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Consequences
* Positive: Secure and compliant payment processing, easy integration, support for various payment methods, high reliability, and scalability.
* Negative: Dependence on a third-party service, and transaction fees associated with each payment.
