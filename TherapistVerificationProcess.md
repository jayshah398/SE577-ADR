# Therapist Verification Process
To ensure the safety and quality of care provided through the PTYou platform, it is crucial to verify the credentials and qualifications of all therapists.  We need to establish a process for verifying that therapists are licensed and qualified to provide physical therapy services.

## Decision 
We will implement the following therapist verification process:
* License Verification:
* * Therapists will be required to provide their license information during the registration process.
* * We will verify the validity of their licenses by checking with the relevant state licensing boards.
* * We will implement automated checks where possible and manual checks for states where automation is not available.
* * Licenses will be checked on an annual basis, and therapists will be notified to renew their information.
* Background Checks:
* * All therapists will be required to undergo a background check.
* * We will partner with a reputable background check provider to conduct these checks.
* * The background check will include checks for criminal records and any disciplinary actions.
* Identity Verification:
* * We will verify the identity of therapists using a third-party identity verification service.
* * This will involve checking their provided information against official records.
* Reference Checks:
* * Therapists will be required to provide professional references.
* * We will contact these references to verify the therapist's experience and qualifications.

## Rationale 
* Patient Safety: Verifying therapist credentials ensures that patients receive care from qualified professionals.
* Legal Compliance: Verifying licenses is necessary to comply with legal requirements and regulations.
* Platform Integrity: A robust verification process helps maintain the integrity and reputation of the PTYou platform.
* Risk Reduction: Verification helps reduce the risk of fraud or malpractice.
Rejected Alternatives:
* Self-Verification: Allowing therapists to self-verify their credentials would not provide sufficient assurance of their qualifications.
* Manual Verification Only: Relying solely on manual verification would be time-consuming and inefficient.

## Consequences
* Positive: Increased patient safety, legal compliance, enhanced platform integrity, and reduced risk of fraud or malpractice.
* Negative: Increased operational costs for conducting verification checks, potential delays in the therapist onboarding process, and the need to handle sensitive therapist information securely.
