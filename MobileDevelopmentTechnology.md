# Mobile Development Technology
The PTYou application needs to be developed for both iOS and Android mobile platforms.  We need to choose a technology that allows us to efficiently develop and maintain the app for both platforms. Factors to consider include development speed, cost, performance, access to native features, and developer availability.

## Decision 
We will use React Native to build the PTYou mobile application.

## Rationale 
* Cross-Platform Efficiency: React Native allows us to write code once and deploy it to both iOS and Android, reducing development time and cost compared to native development (writing separate codebases for each platform).
* Performance: While not always as performant as native, React Native provides near-native performance for most use cases, which is sufficient for the PTYou app's functionality.
* Large Developer Community: React Native has a large and active community, providing ample resources, libraries, and support. This makes it easier to find developers and solve problems.
* Hot Reloading: React Native's hot reloading feature allows developers to see changes in the app without recompiling, speeding up the development process.
* Native Features: React Native provides access to native device features, such as the camera, GPS, and push notifications, which are required for PTYou's functionality (e.g., uploading doctor's scripts, location services for in-person sessions).
Rejected Alternatives:
* Native Development (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android): While offering the best performance and access to platform-specific features, this option would significantly increase development time and cost, as it requires maintaining two separate codebases.
* Flutter: Flutter is another cross-platform framework, but React Native has a larger community and more mature ecosystem.

## Status
[Proposed | __Accepted__ | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Consequences
* Positive: Faster development time, reduced development costs, a single codebase to maintain, and a large pool of developers.
* Negative: Potential performance limitations for very complex or graphics-intensive features, and potential dependency on third-party libraries that may have compatibility issues.
