# HIPAA Compliance Measures
The PTYou application will handle sensitive patient data, including medical information such as doctor's scripts and therapy notes.  Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the application complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to protect patient privacy and security.  We need to define the measures we will take to achieve HIPAA compliance.

## Decision 
We will implement the following measures to ensure HIPAA compliance:
* Data Encryption: All protected health information (PHI) will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using AES-256 encryption).
* Access Controls: We will implement strict access controls to limit access to PHI to authorized personnel only.  This includes role-based access control (RBAC) and strong password policies.
* Audit Trails: We will maintain detailed audit trails of all access to PHI, including who accessed what data and when.
* Secure Data Storage: We will store PHI in a HIPAA-compliant cloud environment (Google Cloud Platform) with appropriate security measures in place.
* Business Associate Agreement (BAA): We will ensure that we have a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with any third-party vendors that handle PHI, such as our cloud provider (Google).
* Regular Security Assessments: We will conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address any vulnerabilities.
* Employee Training: All employees who handle PHI will undergo regular HIPAA training.
* Incident Response Plan: We will develop and maintain an incident response plan to address any security breaches or data breaches.

## Rationale 
* Legal Requirement: HIPAA compliance is a legal requirement for any application that handles PHI.
* Patient Trust: Implementing strong HIPAA compliance measures will help build trust with patients and therapists.
* Data Protection: These measures will protect sensitive patient data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
* Risk Mitigation: Implementing these measures will help mitigate the risk of data breaches and legal penalties.
Rejected Alternatives:
* Minimal Security Measures: Implementing only basic security measures would not be sufficient to meet HIPAA requirements and would put patient data at risk.

## Status
[Proposed | __Accepted__ | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Consequences
* Positive: HIPAA compliance, protection of sensitive patient data, increased patient and therapist trust, and reduced risk of legal penalties.
* Negative: Increased development costs, ongoing costs for security maintenance and audits, and potential complexity in implementing certain security measures.
