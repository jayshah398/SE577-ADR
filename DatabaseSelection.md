# Database Selection 
The PTYou application will need to store various types of data, including user profiles, therapist information, session schedules, medical records (doctor's scripts), and recovery progress. We need to choose a database that can handle this data efficiently, securely, and scalably.  Factors include data structure, query performance, scalability, reliability, security, and cost.

## Decision 
We will use a cloud-based NoSQL database, specifically Google Cloud Firestore, to store the application's data.

## Rationale 
* Flexibility: NoSQL databases like Firestore are well-suited for handling the diverse and potentially evolving data structures of the PTYou application.  We anticipate needing to store different types of user data, and NoSQL allows us to do this without rigid schemas.
* Scalability: Firestore is designed to scale automatically to handle a large number of users and data, which is crucial for the growth of PTYou.
* Performance: Firestore provides fast query performance, which is important for retrieving user data, therapist schedules, and session information quickly.
* Real-time Updates: Firestore supports real-time data synchronization, which can be useful for features like updating session schedules and sending notifications.
* Managed Service: Firestore is a fully managed service, reducing the operational overhead of database administration.
* Cost-Effective: Firestore offers a flexible pricing model that scales with usage, making it cost-effective for both small and large user bases.
* HIPAA Compliance: Google Cloud Platform, and by extension Firestore, can be configured to comply with HIPAA regulations, which is essential for protecting sensitive patient data.
Rejected Alternatives:
* SQL Database: While SQL databases are reliable and mature, they can be less flexible for handling unstructured data and may require more effort to scale.
* Other NoSQL Databases: While viable options, Firestore offers a good balance of features, scalability, and ease of use, along with strong HIPAA compliance support.

## Consequences
* Positive: Flexible data storage, high scalability, good performance, real-time updates, reduced operational overhead, and HIPAA compliance.
* Negative: NoSQL databases may require a different approach to data modeling compared to SQL databases, and there may be a learning curve for developers.
